Suddenly, after a decade of practicing business analysis in the software development area, I've caught a surge to look deeper into modern software construction and packaging matters.

At the moment, the main points of my curiosity are microservices, REST, event sourcing, and message broker stuff. It is not just curiosity but rather a deliberate piece of the effort to get some background in the matter enough to develop business-logic-rich software based on bounded contexts and microservices architecture. And it will be the main subject of the blog.

And there will be some Ruby. For me the choice is obvious - I like its concise but eloquent style that gives me the ability to express myself clearly.

I had some programming experience before, so I understand the software development basics such as OOP, RBDMS, GoF, The Clean Architecture, etc. During my early and short software developer career, I created a few client-server products, and those were successful enough; one of them is still in production for 20 years now.

Beside that, you could meet here some flickering of my requirements management background. And finally, if some thought here will seem strange or clumsy just pardon me my English.
