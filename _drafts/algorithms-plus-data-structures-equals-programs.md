I learned some programming basics in school, fooling around MS-DOS, BasicA, Turbo Pascal, and C. It served me in university where I finished my Turbo Pascal programming course in the first week. I really thought that I was a damn good programmer. But then was a big pause for the next 6-7 years, and when I take a place before PC I saw that programming words changed. I was totally amazed at Win98 and Borland Delphi 5, but it was also quite a shift from MS-DOS to visual programming and that took months to get used to.   

Once when I got some confidence again, I was offered to develop a managing accounting program. And this is the point where my first real architecture problems appeared.




But pick up some modern Ruby book and you'll never see such straight concepts of plain programming language like algorithms and data structures. But you'll bound to see bunch of technologies stuff instead, and you'll certainly see something like database access library, http-request library, web framework, etc. And it won't be a straight consistent overview of those technologies behind, but only fragments and peculiarities of a certain library.
