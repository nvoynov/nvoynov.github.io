I sure most programmers should be familiar with this formula, and perhaps the book of the same name written by Niklaus Wirth and published in l975.

But pick up some modern Ruby book and you'll never see such straight concepts of plain programming language like algorithms and data structures. But you'll bound to see bunch of technologies stuff instead, and you'll certainly see something like database access library, http-request library, web framework, etc. And it won't be a straight consistent overview of those technologies behind, but only fragments and peculiarities of a certain library.
