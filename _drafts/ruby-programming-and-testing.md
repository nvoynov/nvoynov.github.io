A few weeks ago I was asked what do I feel about TDD and I answered that I like it of course. I've known the approach somewhere from 2002, a few days later I caught myself still reflecting on the matter. Does I really like it, and *what* exactly and *why*?

Oddly enough, somewhere in my thoughts on this matter, one of my mates reminded me of the sentence that he heard once from me - "What is not tested does not exist." - can't remember the source for my shame.

But besides this coincidence, that I thank him a lot because it is exactly matched what I feel about testing when developing in Ruby.

For me it's not about decent test coverage, abilities of refactoring, test as documentation, and certainly not about evolving architecture just because "use the code first and then write" (the idea it's interesting of course). It's just about the fact that you cannot say that some code works before it really executed at least one single time. It's true for Ruby but maybe can variate a bit for compiling programming languages.
